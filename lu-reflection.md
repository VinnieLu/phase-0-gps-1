What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I haven't had much trouble with any particular git concepts. I am still getting comfortable with the process, though.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
There was one point where "git fetch" then "git merge" was clarified against "git pull". "git pull" basically fetches and merges all at once, while "git fetch" and "git merge" do the process in two separate steps.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked what the "origin" meant in the "git push origin <BRANCH NAME>" command, and he explained that it is simply the default name that Github uses.

What still confuses you about Git?
Everything about Git basically makes sense so far. I think I'm getting it.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I was taking the reins too much at first, and my partner let me know. It is helpful to have someone to partner with, because you get twice the knowledge. I definitely prefer a GPS to pair programming, because you've got a guru there you can ask questions of. Our guide was great.
