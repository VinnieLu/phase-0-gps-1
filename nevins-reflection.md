What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
```
I haven't been struggling with any concepts thus far
```

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
```
I had not used the "fetch" command but our Guide clarified that the difference between "git fetch" and "git pull" is that "git pull" both fetches the remote repository and merges it with the local repo whereas "git fetch" only fetches the remote repo.
```

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
```
My partner and I asked a few questions. I don't remember all of them but I know that one was about the difference between git fetch and git pull. My partner also asked about the purpose of "origin" when pushing changes to Github.
```

What still confuses you about Git?
```
At this point I don't have any confusions. I feel that I am understanding things well.
```

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
```
It was great, I really enjoyed working with my partner and our guide was great as well. He gave some cool tips and was good at sitting back and letting us work.
